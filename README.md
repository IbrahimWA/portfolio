Hi, I'm Ibrahim!

I think I was drawn towards a career in tech because I am a huge fan of iterative processes and making things better. Seven years later, I still love improving things, whether it's web performance, team processes, or user experience. I am an engineering manager, a frequent user of the JavaScript dev tools, an occasional conference speaker, and a fan of a good diagram for explaining technical concepts to teammates and stakeholders.

I am currently a Data Analyst at Euro Mega Atlantic Nig Ltd.

Prior to my career in Data analytics, I majored in web design and worked as a freelancer and private tutor. My current technical specialties include Excel, Power Bi, SQL, web performance, and data visualization. I have been one of the primary maintainers of Euro Mega's sales data mostly carried out using Excel. I am occasionally involved in participating in giving trainings that helps in building strong technical teams.
