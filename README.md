Hi, I'm Ibrahim!

I think I was drawn towards a career in tech because I am a huge fan of iterative processes and making things better. Seven years later, I still love improving things, whether it's web performance, team processes, or user experience. I am an engineering manager, a frequent user of the JavaScript dev tools, an occasional conference speaker, and a fan of a good diagram for explaining technical concepts to teammates and stakeholders.

I am currently an Engineering Manager at Formidable.

Prior to my career in software, I majored in music education and worked in music and fine arts education. My current technical specialties include React, web performance, and data visualization. I have been one of the primary maintainers of Victory, Formidable's charting library written with React and d3. I manage people, and occasionally give conference talks on state management, refactoring, and building strong technical teams.
